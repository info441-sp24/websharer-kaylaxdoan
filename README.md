I add the site name, so if the object is a part of a larger web site, the name should display like IMDb

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095327/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_grave

Margin-bottom for <p> Tags: I added space between elements because it improves readability and visual separation, making the content within the preview easier to digest at a glance.
